# Portfolio-Efficient
This project was used to show the Bitcoin's effect on traditional assets

Methods:
In this project, I chose 5 industry: stock market, treasury, corporate bond, real estate, commodity 
and created protfolio using the stock price of these industry. 

After that, using python plot the efficient frontier figure of this portfolio.
After finished that part, in order to check the Bitcoin effect on traditional assets, I added Bitcoin into that portfolio, 
changed the weight of each index, compared the return of those two portfolio, 
checked whether the bitcoin have a effect on traditional assets.


Data I used:

stock index -- SPY / HS

30 years treasury bond index -- TYX

10 years corporate bond index -- COR

Real estate index -- DJ

Commodity index -- Gold Price

Bitcoin index -- BTC

I got all of those data from Yahoo, Nasdaq, CME and Binance. I was pretty sure all the data are accurate. 


Files definition:


All the csv files are saved the data of those index for past 10 years (2009-2019)

All the jupyter notwbook files are the code I used in this project

Other docs are the summary and some ratio I used to compare those two portfolio.
